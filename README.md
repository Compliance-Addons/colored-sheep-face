# Colored Sheep Face
Colored Sheep Face is a resource pack for Minecraft Java Edition that works as an add-on for Compliance 32x.
It changes the default sheep texture so that their faces are colored too.

Original idea by Nekzuris.

### How to Install

It is important that the add-on is on top of the Compliance pack!
